I recommend a client to select the right components and I install Monterey to the rig.



Components



Main Asrock Z790 Pro

Cpu i5 13600KF

Gpu r6600xt (I recommend the replacement to Rtx3060)

Ram 32Gb (I recommend to upgrade ram instead of cpu power for a mobile coder)

Storage WD 512 Gb nvme (I recommend to swich from Gammix 512GB in afraid of MN-5236 2.1GB loss space error to the same line of product Gammix Black S70)

Dual monitor (Possible triple with case's Full HD LCD but running out of DP cable)

Note



The LED controler is connected to HS 13 so shoukd be disabled by an USBmap kext. We encounter a minor confusing issue when the case' fan is connected to the same hub of the LED control, instead of Psu. This is the mistake of the hardware supplier. Which lead to hardware failure on the hub.

The installation



The uefi setting of this main is straight as CFG lock is disabled by default.

Efi follow opencore guide for Alder lake, chose simbios macpro 7,1

Cpu name is unknown so I put in i9 13900K as a cosmetic.

Dual boot windows 10

Achieved



Almost every thing works OOB

The client is so interested in the build that he is going to ask me to puts macos on his laptop.
